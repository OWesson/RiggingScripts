First and foremost, these are my personal rigging tools developed to help my workflow. I'm sure there are plenty of baffling programming choices to find in these scripts 
(and I apologize for the pain they may cause you!) but my ultimate priority was to get something that worked, and to get it quickly.

My philosophy was that I wanted each script to operate independently, essentially as a standalone little tool in a single file, rather than having
dozens of dependancies that were hard to keep track of. A script file for each problem to be solved, so to speak. Want limbs automated? Grab the limb file! And so on.

I'm aware there are many redundancies in working this way (such as repeating multiple functions in many files), but for now, working in a manner where files follow similar
formats and operate independantly has allowed me to iterate and create new tools quickly and without complexity.

My script set is, however, bolstered by rigging scripts provided by my lecturer (Anargyros Sarafopoulos) for personal use. I have adapted some of his scripts to
feature GUI interfaces, and developed additional features on top of his automations. His scripts will NOT be uploaded. As such, some of the scripts uploaded will 
be unusable, as they are dependent on his. 

Additionally, I use a set of "helper" scripts in order to create and initialise a custom shelf with my scripts when Maya is launched. These short helper scripts that simply call
my other scripts are not included.
